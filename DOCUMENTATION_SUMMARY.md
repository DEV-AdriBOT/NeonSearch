# 📚 NeonSearch Documentation Summary

## 🚀 **Latest Feature: Advanced Large Content Handling (v0.2.0)**

### 🎯 **Adaptive Rendering System**
NeonSearch now features a comprehensive multi-tier rendering system for websites >25KB:

- **📊 Smart Mode Selection**: Automatic rendering strategy based on content size
- **🌊 Streaming Parser**: Incremental HTML parsing with progress tracking
- **📱 Virtual Scrolling**: Efficient handling of massive DOM trees
- **🧠 Content Analysis**: Intelligent content preservation and truncation
- **⚙️ Background Processing**: Async operations without UI blocking
- **🗜️ Streaming Compression**: Memory-efficient decompression

### 🏗️ **Five-Tier Rendering Strategy**

| Content Size | Mode | Strategy | Features |
|-------------|------|----------|----------|
| **< 25KB** | 🔍 Full | Complete parsing | 100% fidelity, full CSS |
| **25KB - 500KB** | ⚡ Enhanced | Progressive parsing | Prioritized rendering |
| **500KB - 5MB** | 🌊 Streaming | Virtual scrolling | Lazy DOM creation |
| **5MB - 50MB** | 🎯 Efficient | Text-focused | Smart analysis |
| **> 50MB** | 📄 Minimal | Plain text | Link extraction |

### 💾 **Enhanced Memory Management**
Building on the temporary file system (v0.1.1):

- **🎯 Lowered Threshold**: Large content detection now at 25KB (was 50KB)
- **🗂️ Automatic Management**: Files created/cleaned up transparently  
- **🧹 Auto-Cleanup**: Files deleted on tab close or navigation
- **📈 Better Performance**: Eliminates memory pressure from large sites
- **🔄 Zero API Impact**: Existing rendering code works unchanged
