# NeonSearch Large Site Test Guide

## ðŸš€ **UI RESPONSIVENESS FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **Problem Fixed:**
- Google.com (71KB raw â†’ 234KB decompressed) was freezing the UI
- Brotli decompression was blocking the UI thread
- HTML parsing of large content was causing unresponsiveness

### **Solutions Applied:**

1. **ðŸŽ¯ Raw Content Size Threshold**
   - Added 50KB threshold for immediate preview mode
   - Google.com (71KB raw) will trigger fast preview mode
   - Prevents UI blocking during decompression

2. **âš¡ Simplified Rendering**
   - `create_simple_text_page()` skips heavy HTML parsing
   - Quick title extraction without DOM building
   - Minimal processing for large sites

3. **ðŸ“Š Smart Content Handling**
   - Raw content > 50KB: Immediate preview (25KB preview)
   - Decompressed content > 100KB: Standard preview (50KB preview) 
   - Regular content: Full processing

### **Test Sites:**
- **google.com** (71KB raw â†’ should use immediate preview)
- **youtube.com** (likely large â†’ should use preview)
- **facebook.com** (likely large â†’ should use preview)
- **github.com** (medium size â†’ should work normally)

### **Expected Behavior:**
âœ… UI remains responsive during loading
âœ… Large content shows truncation warning
âœ… Decompression works without hanging
âœ… Browser doesn't freeze or crash

### **Technical Details:**
- **Threshold**: 50KB raw content triggers simplified mode
- **Preview Size**: 25KB for large raw content, 50KB for large decompressed
- **Processing**: Skip DOM parsing for very large content
- **Caching**: Decompressed content is cached to prevent re-processing
