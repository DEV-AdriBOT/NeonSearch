**Major Feature**: Production-Ready Download Manager System

---

## 🎉 What's New

### 📥 Download Manager System (Major Feature)

NeonSearch v0.3.0 introduces a comprehensive, production-ready download manager that transforms file downloading capabilities with enterprise-grade features.

#### ✨ Key Features

**Core Functionality:**
- **Concurrent Downloads**: Up to 3 simultaneous downloads with intelligent queue management
- **Resume Support**: Pause and resume interrupted downloads using HTTP Range requests
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time speed indicators (MB/s, KB/s, B/s) with accurate ETA calculations
- **Persistent History**: SQLite database stores all download records with full search capabilities
- **File Integrity**: SHA-256 checksum verification ensures downloads are complete and uncorrupted
- **Smart Retry**: Exponential backoff retry logic (3 attempts with 2s, 4s, 8s delays)

**Security Features:**
- **URL Validation**: Prevents SSRF attacks by blocking localhost and private IP ranges
- **Filename Sanitization**: Automatically removes path traversal sequences (`../`) and dangerous characters
- **Extension Whitelisting**: Validates file extensions against safe types, warns for executables
- **MIME Verification**: Ensures content types match expected formats
- **Disk Space Check**: Pre-download validation to prevent failures (Unix platforms)

**User Interface:**
- **Real-time Progress**: Visual progress bars showing percentage, speed, and ETA
- **Interactive Controls**: Pause, Resume, Cancel, Retry, and Remove buttons
- **Cross-Platform Operations**: "Open File" and "Open Folder" for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Search & Filter**: Find downloads by filename, URL, or status

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### New Modules Added

1. **`src/engine/download_manager.rs`** (450+ lines)
   - Concurrent download engine with semaphore-based limiting
   - Streaming architecture with 64KB chunks for constant memory usage
   - Real-time progress tracking and event system
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff

2. **`src/storage/downloads_db.rs`** (300+ lines)
   - SQLite database with indexed queries
   - Full CRUD operations with type-safe API
   - Automatic cleanup and retention policies
   - Fast search and filter capabilities

3. **`src/security/download_validator.rs`** (250+ lines)
   - Multi-layer security validation
   - URL sanitization to prevent SSRF
   - Filename sanitization to prevent path traversal
   - Extension and MIME type validation

4. **`src/pages/pages/downloads.rs`** (Enhanced, 350+ lines)
   - Complete UI overhaul with real-time updates
   - Interactive download controls
   - Cross-platform file operations
   - Search and filter functionality

```

### Performance Characteristics

- **Memory**: O(1) per download via streaming (not dependent on file size)
- **Network**: Connection pooling via reqwest client reuse
- **Database**: <1ms queries with proper indexing
- **Concurrency**: Semaphore prevents overwhelming system resources

## 📦 Dependencies Added

```toml
rusqlite = { version = "0.32", features = ["bundled"] }  # SQLite database
sha2 = "0.10"                     # SHA-256 checksums
futures-core = "0.3"              # Async streaming
futures-util = "0.3"              # Async utilities
dirs = "5.0"                      # Cross-platform paths
libc = "0.2"                      # Unix disk checks (target-specific)
```

Also enabled the `stream` feature for reqwest to support download streaming.
